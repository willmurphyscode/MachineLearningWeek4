You should create a report describing how you built your model

Building the model
------------------------

The data are structured so that there are many observations per window. A window is an instance of 
one particiapant peforming one weightlifting exercise. Therefore, the first step in building the model is 
to transform the data such that each window is one row. This was accomplished by using a discrete wavelet transform
of numerical vectors that were recorded multiple times per window, based on a method described in [1]. In order
to return a scalar quantity from the discrete wavelet transform, the mean of the coefficients was taken. Additionally,
in order to presever information about the magnitude of the covariates, a separate set of covariates was computed
by taking the arithmetic mean of the covariates. 

, how you used cross validation

The data were cross-validated by reserving 25% of the training windows for validation.  The training data were divided
into training and cross validation sets using `caret::createDataPartition`.    

, what you think the expected out of sample error is
Based on this validation, I estimate the out of sample error to be less than or equal to `r percentCorrect`%. 

, and why you made the choices you did.
