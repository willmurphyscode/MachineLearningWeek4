You should create a report describing how you built your model

Building the model
------------------------

The data are structured so that there are many observations per window. A window is an instance of 
one particiapant peforming one weightlifting exercise. Therefore, the first step in building the model is 
to transform the data such that each window is one row. This was accomplished by using the mean of all numerical
observations taken during the window, and the first of all non-numerical observations taken during the window. 

, how you used cross validation

The data were cross-validated by reserver 25% of the training windows for validation. Based on this validation,
I estimate the out of sample error to be >= to  

install.packages("data.table", type = "source",
                 repos = "https://Rdatatable.github.io/data.table")

, what you think the expected out of sample error is


, and why you made the choices you did.
